I'm a Staff Software Engineer based out of Philadelphia, working at Walmart on
the GraphQL Platform team. I love writing code, especially in Rust and
TypeScript. I'm a fan of experimenting with new programming languages, and I
have a deep interest in learning how to write compilers in my free time. I love
bikes, hate cars, and I'm a big proponent for walkable cities.
