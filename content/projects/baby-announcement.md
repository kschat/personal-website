#### Baby Announcement

A baby announcement disguised as a fun quiz game. Users can create and join
quiz sessions where they'll be asked the same question on their phones, waiting
for everyone to answer before moving on. Once the last question is answered by
all players, the baby announcement is displayed and a ham horn is played. The
web app also uses the front facing camera to record everyone's reaction to the
news, which can then be downloaded. I used TypeScript for the client and the
server.
