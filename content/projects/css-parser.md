#### CSS Parser

My dream is to day write programming languages professionally. I also dream of
being able to write Rust and _not_ fight with the borrow checker. That's why I
tried my hand at writing a toy CSS parser in Rust. It follows the CSS 3 spec,
though is far from complete. This was my first time writing a parser that
followed an established spec - although initially terse, the spec helped a ton
with my implementation.
