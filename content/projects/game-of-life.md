#### Conway's Game of Life

My attempt at implementing Conway's Game of Life. Written in TypeScript using
the WebGL API. I initially implemented this using the standard DOM API, which
proved to be slow. In an effort to get better performance and to learn how to
write shaders, I ported it to use WebGL. I think more time went into learning
how to play the Game of Life than actually implementing it.
