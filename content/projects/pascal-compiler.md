#### Pascal Compiler

My first venture into learning how to write a compiler, I followed along with
Writing Compilers and Interpreters: A Software Engineering Approach. I learned
a lot from this book and project, including different techniques to parsing a
grammar, how compilers are typically structured, and how to provide helpful
error messages that point out the exact issue in the source code. This was
also the project I used to learn TypeScript.
