#### Portfolio Site

My attempt at creating my own, custom portfolio site from scratch. It was
originally written in PHP when I was college, but was completely rewritten in
2013 to get a better feel for Node.js. I've since rewritten it again in 2020
to be simpler, use a proper build process, and use TypeScript.
