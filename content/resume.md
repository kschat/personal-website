*Projects*

**Snake**
**[github.com/kschat/snake](https://github.com/kschat/snake)**
* Wrote a Snake clone for terminal emulators using Rust. Used crossterm for cross-platform terminal emulator support, and developed a very basic engine/game-loop that supports targeting a specific framerate, registering and loading scenes, processing input, and buffering draw calls.

**Baby Announcement**
**[github.com/kschat/baby-announcement](https://github.com/kschat/baby-announcement)**
* A baby announcement disguised as a fun quiz game. Users can create and join quiz sessions where they'll be asked the same question on their phones, waiting for everyone to answer before moving on. Once the last question is answered by all players, the baby announcement is displayed and a ham horn is played. The web app also uses the front facing camera to record everyone's reaction to the news, which can then be downloaded. I used TypeScript for the client and the server.

**Trampoline TS**
**[github.com/kschat/trampoline-ts](https://github.com/kschat/trampoline-ts)**
* A small package I wrote because I needed to emulate tail-call optimizations and none of the existing packages were type safe. The package has 100% code coverage (including tests for the more complicated types), and uses semantic-release to automate the build process.
