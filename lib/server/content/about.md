@WalmartLabs Software Engineer living in Philadelphia. I enjoy writing code in
TypeScript, Kotlin, and Rust, though I'm not very good at the latter.  I'm
almost always working on RESTful or GraphQL service. I enjoy experimenting with
new programming languages, and have a deep interest in learning how to write
compilers in my free time (though, I don't get much of that anymore). I'm a
masochist so naturally I'm a vim user.
